# Today: A habit tracker

### About

This project was inspired by a habit tracking techique that I found through [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bxIg3M_MHY) video. I couldn't find something exactly like this online and was looking to grow my skills in web development so I thought I'd made one!


### Implementation Details

This project uses Bootstrap for the front-end and Express Js / Node Js for the routing and backend and mongoDB was used for data-persistence.
